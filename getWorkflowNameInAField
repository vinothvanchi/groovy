/**
Create this Scripted Field in Jira, if you need a way to search issues by workflow name.

This is a searchable custom field that displays the workflow name

In reality, you don't have to add this field to any screens to use
it, because it will always be populated and available on every
issue (just not visible).  Here's an example of the JQL:

Example 1:
"Workflow Name" = "jira"

Example 2:
resolution is EMPTY ORDER BY "Workflow Name" DESC 
**/

import com.atlassian.jira.component.ComponentAccessor

def workflowManager = ComponentAccessor.workflowManager
workflowManager.getWorkflow(issue).name
